This mod is a mod which add a new ore with lots of new items like
heal sticks, sticks of god ect... and a new armor with new tools.
The Pintium Hammer is here !
I've had some entities like ratels... Bananosaurs and some
Bananofish too. And a strange tuna too. Cannabis is there.

Some spells have been added. K to test them et discover them.
To use correctly Ignis and Zombium you need to hit an entity before.

Mole Mutatio : Take a block and transform into it !
Ignis : Launch a FireBall which is gonna attack your last attacked entity !

Navis : Spawn a boat
Zombium : Spawn some baby zombies who are gonna attack your last attacked ennemy !

There is a new amazing Item :
The Stick of Life. You will be able to tame ANY entities.
For the moment you can only tame Ratel, Zombie, Skeleton and Creeper
but in few hours you will be able to tame mores.

To tame entities, you have to kill it, get a heal orb in your inventory and right click
with the life stick !

You can now fight the bananather ! Create it with banana block (discover the pattern yourself
it is a little bit tricky but don't worry it is easy)
And with the bananather you are able to get the Life Stick easily !
